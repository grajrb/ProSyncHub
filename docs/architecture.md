## Component Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js, a React framework that supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

#### Key Components:

1. **Pages and Routes**:
   - Dashboard views
   - Asset management
   - Work order management
   - Analytics and reporting
   - User management
   - Settings

2. **State Management**:
   - React Context API for global state
   - React Query for server state and caching

3. **Real-time Communication**:
   - Socket.IO client for real-time updates
   - WebSocket connection for live asset metrics

4. **UI Components**:
   - Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI)
   - Custom components for domain-specific features
   - Responsive design for mobile compatibility

### Backend (Express)

The backend is built with Express.js, providing RESTful API endpoints and WebSocket connections.

#### Key Components:

1. **API Layer**:
   - Express.js routes and controllers
   - JWT authentication middleware
   - Request validation and error handling

2. **Real-time Layer**:
   - Socket.IO server for bidirectional communication
   - Redis Pub/Sub for scalable event distribution

3. **Service Layer**:
   - Business logic implementation
   - Data processing and transformation
   - Third-party service integration

4. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL
   - Mongoose ODM for MongoDB
   - Redis client for caching and temporary data

### Data Architecture

ProSyncHub uses a multi-database approach to leverage the strengths of different database types:

1. **PostgreSQL (Relational Database)**:
   - Users and authentication
   - Assets and equipment details
   - Work orders and maintenance records
   - Parts inventory
   - Configuration settings

2. **MongoDB (NoSQL Database)**:
   - Event logs and activity history
   - Telemetry data and time series metrics
   - Notification records
   - User activity feeds

3. **Redis (In-memory Data Store)**:
   - Caching frequently accessed data
   - Pub/Sub messaging for real-time events
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting and temporary data

## Authentication and Security

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Access tokens and refresh tokens
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Permission-based feature access
   - API endpoint protection

3. **Security Measures**:
   - HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Helmet.js for HTTP security headers
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Real-time Communication

1. **WebSocket Communication**:
   - Socket.IO for bidirectional communication
   - Room-based subscriptions for specific assets or areas
   - Authentication and authorization for socket connections

2. **Event Distribution**:
   - Redis Pub/Sub for scalable event broadcasting
   - Event types for different notifications
   - Message queuing for reliable delivery

## Predictive Maintenance System

1. **ML Pipeline**:
   - Data collection from assets
   - Feature engineering and preprocessing
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Prediction serving

2. **Integration with Main Application**:
   - API endpoints for prediction requests
   - Scheduled jobs for regular health assessments
   - Notification triggers for predicted issues

## Deployment Architecture

ProSyncHub is designed to be deployed in various environments:

1. **Development**:
   - Local development with Docker Compose
   - Hot reloading for rapid iteration

2. **Production**:
   - Containerized deployment with Docker
   - Kubernetes orchestration for scaling
   - Load balancing and high availability
   - Cloud provider agnostic (AWS, Azure, GCP)

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated testing with Jest and Cypress
   - Build and deployment automation
   - Environment-specific configurations

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless API servers for easy scaling
   - Redis for distributed session management
   - Database read replicas for query scaling

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Caching strategies for frequent data
   - Query optimization and indexing
   - Connection pooling for databases

3. **Data Management**:
   - Data partitioning strategies
   - Archiving old data
   - Backup and disaster recovery plans

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Logging**:
   - Centralized logging with Winston
   - Structured log format (JSON)
   - Log levels for different environments

2. **Metrics**:
   - System and application metrics collection
   - Performance monitoring
   - Resource utilization tracking

3. **Error Tracking**:
   - Exception capturing and reporting
   - Error aggregation and analysis
   - Alerting for critical issues

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Service Separation**:
   - Further decomposition into microservices
   - API Gateway for request routing
   - Service discovery mechanisms

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Data warehouse integration
   - Business intelligence dashboards
   - Advanced reporting capabilities

3. **Edge Computing**:
   - Local processing of asset data
   - Reduced latency for critical operations
   - Offline capabilities for remote locations
